# WorkoutLogger

## Project Description
This is a simple user interface for my Workout API project. The structure of
this project is based on what I learned in the following course: https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react

 The basic technology stack is:
* React (UI Library)
* Bootstrap (front-end component library)
* Joi-browser (user-input validation)
* React-router-dom (routing)
